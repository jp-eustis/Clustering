Kmeans:
	The initial starting points actually represented the classes well when looking at the dataset, It was almost spot on in defining
The different types of animals per cluster. However the classification modell(decision table) only chose four attributes to take into
account. The Kmeans model took 7 attributes into account which better represents the dataset. Even though the starting points were
almost spot on in terms of classification the final cluster made the data a little bit more foggy. it was saying every cluster besides 
one would have legs which is not true, and it said one class on average would only have one leg. The other true false values did seem
relatively accurate with slight misconceptions every so often.

EM(predictive clustering):
	The predictive clustering made four clusters which made it hard to compare to the dataset, but easy to compare to the decision table.
It was relatively similar to the decision table however it did take into account a lot more variables which was to be expected. It was
comparable to the decision table when estamating feathers(DT:2T,4F)(EM:1T,3F) and airborne(DT:3T,3F)(EM:2T,2F)

EM(set clusters):
	The set clusters were accurate in terms of aquatic(3F,3T), predator(4F,2T) and tail(1F,5T), the rest of the data was not similiar based
on number of instances but wasn't incredibly innacurate.
